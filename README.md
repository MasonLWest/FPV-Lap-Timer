Using the Program
When you run the LapTracker program, a GUI window will appear. The window will contain four rows, each corresponding to a racer. Each row will have two fields: a racer name field and a lap time field.

To enter a racer name, click on the corresponding entry field and type the name. To enter a lap time, click on the corresponding entry field and type the time in the format mm:ss.ms. For example, to enter a lap time of 1 minute and 23.456 seconds, type 01:23.456.

You can leave the name and lap time fields blank if a racer is not participating in the race.

To submit the lap times, click on the Submit button at the bottom of the window. If any of the racer names or lap times are invalid, an error message will be displayed.

Once you have submitted the lap times, a new window will appear displaying the lap times for each racer. The lap times will be listed in order from fastest to slowest.

To exit the program, click on the Exit button at the bottom of the main window.
